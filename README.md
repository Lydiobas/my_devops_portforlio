why devops ?

My name is Lydia, and I am 33 years old. I have worked as a junior DevOps engineer for over 3 years at a company called MTN. Before that, I was a high school teacher, teaching Information and Communication Technology. I developed a passion for IT, which led me to transition into this field, as it aligns with my background in computer science, where I specialized in the ICT department.

In my role, I assisted with an automation project to ensure quality for applications, implemented monitoring, and integrated automated testing into the DevOps lifecycle. This was done under the supervision of a senior DevOps engineer, Honorable Dan.

I also have project samples on a devops role that a company requested to showcase my talents for a DevOps position I applied for; my work was well-received. However, I was not interested in the position because it involved presentations and training for internships, which I was not keen on since I wanted to move away from teaching. Additionally, I was preparing to relocate to the USA, as my visa was already in hand.
